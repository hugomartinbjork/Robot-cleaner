# Robot-cleaner
Had a great time implementing a virtual vacuum cleaner robot as part of a school project. You can find my modified solution in 'myvacuumagent.py'. 
Since the agent is unaware of its surroundings I implemented a heat map in order to keep the agent "curious" and  is prone to explore new environments. 
I also added a file named "have_fun.py" without a solution programmed so that you can try it for yourself:)
