# Robot-cleaner
 Had a great time implementing a virtual vacuum cleaner robot. You can find my solution in 'myvacuumagent.py'. 
 Since the agent is unaware of its surroundings I implemented a heat map in order to keep the agent "curious" and is prone to explore new environments. 
 I also added a file named "have_fun.py" so you can try it for yourself:)
